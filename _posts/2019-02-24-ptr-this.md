# Pointer ```this```

In theory, it's object calls a member function rather than a member function calls an object. But sometimes a member function indeed have to handle the object itself(rather than its member). The pointer ```this``` is designed for the need. What's more, when a member function access a private member in an object, the full name of a member can and should be pointed by ```this```. For instance, what ```Stock::acquire``` access is factually ```this -> shares```(if it will).
