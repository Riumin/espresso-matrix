        abstract: Terms of service of on-line platforms too often contain clauses
            that are potentially unfair to the consumer. We present an experimental
            study where machine learning is employed to automatically detect such
            potentially unfair clauses. Results show that the proposed system could
            provide a valuable tool for lawyers and consumers alike.
