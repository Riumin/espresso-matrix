In wonder of what ever happened on earth around from time to time mayhap, you ask for the story backward another over and over again. Modern Society, prehistoric humanity, our intelligent and mysterious ancestors who immigrant from continent to continent, various dinosaurs, early forms of creatures, the <span title="the creature with only a single cell, the initial form of life" style="font-weight: bold">monad</span>, the earth before life, and finally the very beginning of the earth and the vast universe. Those questions upon anything surrounding us which scales to infinity used to enlighten greatest religions, cultures and, at the present, science.

The earlier generations have been studying the origin of everything in connection with us by tracking the farthest sky and digging the most distant <span title="the layer beneath the surface of the earth, consisting of diverse rocks" style="font-weight: bold">statum</span>, and till the present day there generates a series of rather sophisticated subjects which throw out models to explain how everything around us takes birth, form and variation from the very initial to the very terminate. 

Biology, geology, astronomy, and finally physics, we are trying our best to build up a most persuasive and then acceptable model along with the fast improvement of exploring techniques. So far ha' 'e stepped too numerous and too complex paths, absolutely unreachable  for the later generations, which contains ourselves as well in view of the elders. Eventually or mayhap initially,  science just cannot tell out the illustration to the confuses so alluring and addicting, at least not so as our believes and romance.

So long has the saying of [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant) echos, the galaxy nonsense and undeniable. Ever since the time when the rivals of [Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau) spare no effort to recover the  reconstruction by disproving the source of power's <span title="where does the power lie legal" style="font-weight: bold">legislation</span>, we ourselves have been <span title="to purge or remove something from somewhere" style="font-weight: bold">dispelling</span> one and another coming curiosities, response to whom  beneath somewhere underlying able to save us  back to reality from a fairyland. 

Life cannot be confused with phantasy even though it lengthens like a dream at a speed higher than our thought, so it is our biological pales, our planet and universe. I'm afraid that's the reason why we constantly chase after a lifelong exploration over everything around us. 

Let's just simply date back to the time when childish and inexperienced ourselves attempt to draw a script of what we wanna know. As we tear some certain states of information into pieces and reform and joint them to a logical union, we mimic to be acknowledged how the world be. Actually, we truly make it, at least during a short period of time.

> The geology of an area changes through time as rock units are deposited and inserted, and deformational processes change their shapes and locations.[@wikipedia_geology]

If anything to do with the marvelous and previously immortal history of the earth within <span title="as well as geoscience, includes all fields of natural science related to the planet Earth" style="font-weight: bold">earth science</span>, geology shall be at the first place. Ever since the first publishing of the prediction about the variation of the earth layers within fossils and rocks, *De solido intra solidum naturaliter contento*, modern geology's <span title="a piece of fabric or cloth for covering face." style="font-weight: bold">veil</span> recovered as considered. For centuries geologists have been digging out one and another exposed tombs of creatures and earth movement and their biography written within considering existence, taking advantage of the fast developing techniques to capture the streams from a more and more *informationalized* world.

Those ambiguous archaeology finally get to a so-called **geologic time scale**[@geologic_time_scale], which has been adopted into numerous variations, **geologic clock** included(figure ). Just like those excellent scholars who developed their theory upon something ever happend millions, billions and trillions of years ago based on those "archealogical" consequence, but to simply stare at the time scale with abstract description they drawed enable us to imagined a vivid world such a long time ago, especially in an "age" of virtual graphicalization.

"What ever happend on the earth?" This question seems to be a hot topic in a society with more and more cheap and popular knowledge. Out of the professional labs and speech academic reporting halls, the history of our planet comes to generates increasing believes, romance and ration, in result of diverse form of media products. It ends up not that necessary to restrict research within ivory tower for us. Yet it ends nothing yet, for the very few people beyond pure psychological loss instead of true curiosity. It is exactly those guys who stood out of the noble in villa who feed their mental pain with the one true god beyond morality that led religion live to theology and till modern science. Exploration still.
