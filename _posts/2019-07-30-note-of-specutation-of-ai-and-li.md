        abstract: Terms of service of on-line platforms too often contain clauses
            that are potentially unfair to the consumer. We present an experimental
            study where machine learning is employed to automatically detect such
            potentially unfair clauses. Results show that the proposed system could
            provide a valuable tool for lawyers and consumers alike.

# Unfair Terms/Clauses of Service in Contract
## What cause a contractual term unfair?

> According to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: (1) it has not been individually negotiated; and (2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties’ rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer. <br/>
> *CLAUDETTE: an automated detector of potentially unfair clauses in online terms of service*, *Artificial Intelligence and Law*, Volume 27, Issue 2, June 2019

> The unfairness of contract may involve Contract Law. More details awaits annotation.

## How 

(1) establishing jurisdiction for disputes in a country different than consumer’s residence; 

(2) choice of a foreign law governing the contract; 

(3) limitation of liability; 

(4) the provider’s right to unilaterally terminate the contract/access to the service;

(5) the provider’s right to unilaterally modify the contract/the service.

(6) requiring a consumer to undertake arbitration before the court proceedings can commence; 

(7) the provider retaining the right to unilaterally remove consumer content from the service, including in-app purchases; 

(8) having a consumer accept the agreement simply by using the service, not only without reading it, but even without having to click on "I agree/I accept".
