# Unfair Terms/Clauses of Service in Contract
## What cause a contractual term unfair?

> According to art. 3 of the Directive 93/13 on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts, a contractual term is unfair if: (1) it has not been individually negotiated; and (2) contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties’ rights and obligations, to the detriment of the consumer. <br/>

## How 

(1) establishing jurisdiction for disputes in a country different than consumer’s residence; 

(2) choice of a foreign law governing the contract; 

(3) limitation of liability; 

(4) the provider’s right to unilaterally terminate the contract/access to the service;

(5) the provider’s right to unilaterally modify the contract/the service.

(6) requiring a consumer to undertake arbitration before the court proceedings can commence; 

(7) the provider retaining the right to unilaterally remove consumer content from the service, including in-app purchases; 

(8) having a consumer accept the agreement simply by using the service, not only without reading it, but even without having to click on "I agree/I accept".
