Mermaid is a graphicalization tool by javascripts implenmented in Hypertext Mark Text, which provides an excellent visual effect in a form of flowchart, gantt, sequence, etc. Since the time when its version 7 published have I deployed it for my websites and blogs. Recently the newest version 8 carry on **state** and **pie** diagram in a much more brilliant graphical items.
