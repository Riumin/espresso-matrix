# What is Evergreen of Hall?
**Evergreen of Hall** is a virtual blog for **Elthough Alph** and his fans. The works produced by **Elthough Alph** put up on the website for view and discussion, his works ranged from natural science to humanity to arts. The thoughts and theorems are just like a cup of psychological espresso, fragrant and warning your mind. The indeed once shaped entity **Evergreen of Hall** as well as a political metaphor is referred from the very initial novel **The Conspirator Drinks Espresso**, too.

> Evergreen of Hall locates at Nâ€™port, end of the route that people from the continent travel across the water to reach this island. It is where the French windows shape those virtual walls decorated with so different and unique scenery behind the transparent boarder, which tempts the guests to go outdoor and take a view in person. Yet murmur-like crepitating fireplace, dinner table, soft armchairs and warm-toned furniture with marvelous crystal chandelier and goblets shining glimmer inside Evergreen of Hall, whose guest pinches the edge of a saucer and enjoys a cup of espresso hanging around, ubiquitous postmoderinism spreads amid the thorough room, from the colorfully polished interior design to the knitted carpet.
